I am an incoming PhD student at the Scalable Principles for Learning and Reasoning Lab ([SphereLab](https://spherelab.ai/)) of the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), in the [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) department, advised by Prof. [Weiyang Liu](https://wyliu.com/), working on reinforcement learning for formal reasoning. Previously, I spent a wonderful year at HKGAI, [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), as a PhD student advised by Prof. [Yike Guo](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=yike-guo-yikeguo). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en).

During the long-term future (maybe 2024-2027), I will be (almost) entirely focused on [exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04728)-based reinforcement learning for [formal mathematics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02735) reasoning and its agentic use of [large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19327). I am also interested in their applications in model-based [embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06964) and scientific discovery via formal verification (e.g., [Scientist AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15657), [PhysLean](https://github.com/HEPLean/PhysLean)).
